                Rock, Paper, Scissors: Brawl is a 2D multiplayer game that is a combination of
                Rock, Paper, Scissors and tag. The game is played in an arena where players can
                move around and attack other players. Players can choose between three different
                attacks: rock, paper, and scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and
                paper beats rock.
            </p>
            <p class="game-desc">
                You move your character around with the WASD keys. You use Q and E to toggle between
                rock, paper, and scissors. You attack other players by touching them with your chosen
                character state. Collect powerups to gain an advantage over your opponents. The game
                ends when time runs out. The player with the highest kill streak wins.
